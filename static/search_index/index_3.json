After downloading the source code, use the command 'make prepare_sourcecode' to automatically download the toolchain to the current compilation directory. If you don't use the docker compilation environment but prefer to use native Linux for compilation, you can refer to `tools/docker/Dockerfile` to install the corresponding tools into your Linux system. If the download speed is slow or unsuccessful, you can use `tools/docker/Dockerfile` to compile the docker image yourself. For details, please refer to [K230 SDK Usage Instructions](https://github.com/kendryte/k230_docs/blob/main/zh/01_software/board/K230_SDK_使用说明.md#43 编译 sdk) ### Compiling K230 SDK #### Download K230 SDK Source Code ```shell git clone https://github.com/kendryte/k230_sdk cd k230_sdk make prepare_sourcecode ``` >`make prepare_sourcecode` will automatically download Linux and RT Smart toolchain, buildroot package, AI package, etc. Please ensure this command executes successfully without any Errors. Download time and speed depend on actual network speed. #### Start Compiling K230 SDK Taking docker image compilation as an example: 1. Confirm the current directory is the `k230_sdk` source code root directory, 2. Use the following command to enter docker ```shell docker run u root it v $(pwd):$(pwd) v $(pwd)/toolchain:/opt/toolchain w $(pwd) ghcr.io/kendryte/k230_sdk /bin/bash ``` >Select different config configurations for compilation based on different development boards or software functions. Compilation command format: `make CONF xxx`, for example: >To compile K230 USIP LP3 EVB board image, execute `make CONF k230_evb_defconfig` command to start compilation >To compile CanMV K230 board image, execute `make CONF k230_canmv_defconfig` command to start compilation > The automatically downloaded toolchain in the external directory will be mapped to the `/opt/toolchain/` directory in the docker image. > The default parameter ` u root` specifies docker to execute as root user, k230_sdk can be compiled without root permissions > Please use the complete path `ghcr.io/kendryte/k230_sdk` for the docker image. If using a locally compiled docker image, please modify the name accordingly #### Compilation Products Introduction Taking the products generated by make CONF k230_evb_defconfig compilation as an example: ```shell k230_evb_defconfig/images ├── big core ├── env.env ├── jffs2.env ├── little core ├── sysimage sdcard.img # SD and eMMC non secure boot image ├── sysimage sdcard.img.gz # SD and eMMC non secure boot image compressed package ├── sysimage spinor32m.img # norflash non secure boot image ├── sysimage spinor32m.img.gz # norflash non secure boot image compressed package └── sysimage spinor32m_jffs2.img # norflash jffs2 non secure boot image ``` Both TF card and eMMC can use the` sysimage sdcard.img` image, or use `sysimage sdcard.img.gz` decompressed to get this file. ### Pre compiled Image Download If you don't want to compile the image yourself, you can download pre compiled images and use them directly for flashing. 1. **[main branch](https://github.com/kendryte/k230_sdk/tree/main) ** as a release branch, compiled release images are automatically published to the [Release](https://github.com/kendryte/k230_sdk/releases) page. (Supported from v1.4 version) 2.Pre compiled release images: Please visit [Canaan Developer Community](https://developer.canaan creative.com/resource), then in the `K230/Images` category, download the required image files. For `evb` devices download` k230_evb*.img.gz`, for `canmv` devices download `k230_canmv*.img.gz`. >The downloaded images are in .gz compressed format by default, which needs to be decompressed first before flashing. >The K230 micropython image supports different functions compared to K230 SDK. ### Flashing Image Files #### Flashing TF Card If using Linux to flash TF card, you need to first confirm the TF card name in the system `/dev/sdx`, and replace `/dev/sdx` in the following command. ```shell sudo dd if sysimage sdcard.img of /dev/sdx bs 1M oflag sync ``` If using Windows for flashing, it is recommended to use the [rufus tool](http://rufus.ie/downloads/). For other more detailed flashing methods, please refer to K230 SDK documentation. ### Power On and Boot #### K230 EVB Development Board Power On and Boot K230 EVB supports multiple boot methods including SDCard, eMMC, norflash, etc. Users can switch between different boot modes by changing the boot [switch](https://github.com/kendryte/k230_docs/blob/main/zh/00_hardware/K230_DEMO_BOARD资源使用指南.md#电源区开机上电方式)settings on the board. For development convenience, it is recommended to prepare a TF card and set the boot switch to SD card boot mode. Later, you can consider burning the image file to eMMC. 1. Please first **confirm that the startup switch SW1 is set to the SD card startup mode** (for details, please refer to [Power on Method](https://github.com/kendryte/k230_docs/blob/main/zh/00_hardware/K230_DEMO_BOARD资源使用指南.md#电源区开机上电方式) 2. Insert the TF card with the completed burning into the TF card slot of the development board 3. Connect the power supply to the development board 4. **Pull the power switch K1 to the ON position**, and the system can be powered on and started 5. If you have connected the serial port, you can see the startup log output in the serial port. #### CanMV K230 Development Board Power On and Boot K230 CanMV K230 development board supports SDCard boot method and HDMI output display. Therefore, you need to prepare a TF card, and it is recommended to prepare an HDMI monitor. 1. Insert the TF card that has been programmed into the TF card slot of the development board. 2. Power on the development board. At this point, the system can be powered on and started. After the system is powered on, by default, there will be **two serial port devices**, which can be used respectively to access the small core Linux and the large core RTSmart. The default username for the small core Linux is \"root\" and the password is empty. In the large core RTSmart system, an application will automatically start at boot. You can press the `q` key to exit to the command prompt terminal. base platform: `Ubuntu 20.04` Refer to BUILD, you can use Docker or local environment for compilation, compilation speed is faster.Or refer to K230 CanMV Custom Firmware * Flashing: Under Linux, directly use the dd command for flashing. Under Windows, use flashing tools. Refer to K230 CanMV How to Flash Firmware. * Operator: * Compile firmware: ```shell cd canmv_k230 time make log ``` `canmv_k230/output/k230_canmv_v3p0` generates `CanMV K230 V3P0_rtsmart_localnncase_v2.9.0.img` which can be burned onto an SD card * Compile app: Change to current directory canmv_k230 ```shell cd canmv_k230/src/rtsmart/mpp source build_env.sh cd userapps/sample/sample_display make ``` In the sample/elf directory, generate sample_display.elf Default app: sample_display Rename sample_display.elf to `app.elf`, copy to the SD card's sdcard partition, reboot, and it will run by default."},"/get_started/en/AI/T-Circle-S3/T-Circle-S3.html":{"title":"LILYGO T-Circle S3","content":" title: LILYGO T Circle S3 show_source: false tags: T Circle S3, LCD, ESP32 S3, Audio <div style \"width:100%; display:flex;justify content: center;\"> ![T Circle](./assets/T Circle S3 1.jpg) </div> <div style \"padding: 1em 0 0 0; display: flex; justify content: center\"> <a target \"_blank\" style \"margin: 1em;color: white; font size: 0.9em; border radius: 0.3em; padding: 0.5em 2em; background color:rgb(103, 175, 8)\" href \"https://lilygo.cc/products/t circle s3\">Official Store</a> </div> > **Note**: T Circle S3 is the ESP32 S3 version.

[Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) 3. [Platform IO](https://platformio.org/) ## Related Tests ## Q&A 1. This development board uses USB as the JTAG upload port. If you need to print serial port information via USB, you must enable the \"USB_CDC_ON_BOOT\" configuration. If you cannot find the port when uploading the program, or the USB is used for other functions causing the port not to be displayed, please manually enter the upload mode: 1. Connect the development board via a USB cable 2. Press and hold the \"BOOT button\" and simultaneously press the \"RST button\" 3. Release the \"RST button\" first 4. Then release the \"BOOT button\" 5. Upload the program 2. If the above methods do not work, please burn the [binary file](https://github.com/Xinyuan LilyGO/LilyGO T Wristband and T Glass/tree/master/firmware/README.MD)to check if the hardware is functioning properly. 3. If an external power supply is used instead of USB C power supply, please disable the **USB_CDC_ON_BOOT** option. This is because the development board waits for USB connection upon startup. For Arduino IDE users, you can disable this function in the options. Please note that disabling **USB_CDC_ON_BOOT** will disable the USB C serial port redirection. At this point, opening the port via USB C will not display any serial port information. The information will be output from GPIO43 and GPIO44: ```c Tools > USB CDC On Boot > Disable ``` For Platformio users, you can add the following compilation flags in the ini file: ```c build_flags ; Enabling DARDUINO_USB_CDC_ON_BOOT will start printing and wait for the terminal to connect during startup. ; DARDUINO_USB_CDC_ON_BOOT 1 ; Enabling UARDUINO_USB_CDC_ON_BOOT will disable the printing function and will not cause any blocking when powered by a battery. UARDUINO_USB_CDC_ON_BOOT ``` 4. The RAM of the JD9613 display is only half the size of the screen, and it does not support rotation. Direction 0 and 1 can adjust the vertical direction, while directions 1 and 3 are in the same direction: ```c // Set the screen to landscape mode. 0 and 2 represent two opposite vertical directions. amoled.setRotation(0); amoled.setRotation(2); // Set the screen to landscape mode, with directions 1 and 3 being the same and unable to be changed. amoled.setRotation(1); amoled.setRotation(3); ``` ## project Product(PinMap) schematic [T Glass][1] [schematic](https://github.com/Xinyuan LilyGO/LilyGO T Wristband and T Glass/blob/master/schematic/LilyGO T Wristband and T Glass.pdf) [T Wristband][2] [schematic](https://github.com/Xinyuan LilyGO/LilyGO T Wristband and T Glass/blob/master/schematic/LilyGO T Wristband and T Glass.pdf) ## Dependent Libraries * [SensorLib 0.1.8](https://github.com/lewisxhe/SensorsLib) * [lvgl 8.4.0](https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl/tree/release/v8.4) * [MadgwickAHRS](https://github.com/arduino libraries/MadgwickAHRS)"},"/get_started/en/Display/T-Display-S3-AMOLED-1.75/T-Display-S3-AMOLED-1.75.html":{"title":"LILYGO T-Display S3 AMOLED 1.43","content":" title: LILYGO T Display S3 AMOLED 1.43 show_source: false tags: AMOLED, Display <! **[English](README.MD) Chinese** > <div style \"width:100%; display:flex;justify content: center;\"> ![T Display S3 AMOLED 1.75](./assets/T Display S3 AMOLED 1.75 1.jpg) </div> <div style \"padding: 1em 0 0 0; display: flex; justify content: center\"> <a target \"_blank\" style \"margin: 1em;color: white; font size: 0.9em; border radius: 0.3em; padding: 0.5em 2em; background color:rgb(63, 201, 28)\" href \"https://lilygo.cc/products/t display s3 amoled 1 64?variant 44848332931253\">Official Store</a> </div> ## Version History: Version Update Date Update Description : : : : : T Display S3 AMOLED 1.43_V1.0 2024 05 20 Initial Version T Display S3 AMOLED 1.43 1.75_V1.0 2024 11 25 Added FPC cable, added H0175Y003AM screen support T Display S3 AMOLED 1.43 1.75_V1.0 2025 01 13 Added DO0143FMST10 screen support ## Purchase Link Product SOC FLASH PSRAM Link : : : : : : : : : : T Display S3 AMOLED 1.43 1.75 ESP32S3R8 16M 8M (Octal SPI) [LILYGO Mall](https://lilygo.cc/products/t display s3 amoled 1 64?_pos 8&_sid eacfa858d&_ss r) ## Description T Display AMOLED Plus is a highly integrated development board based on the ESP32 S3 microcontroller, focusing on multi functionality and high performance.

I still don't know how to set up the programming environment after reading the above tutorial. What should I do?** A. If you still don't understand how to set up the environment after reading the above tutorial, you can refer to the [LilyGo Document](https://github.com/Xinyuan LilyGO/LilyGo Document) documentation for setup instructions. <br /> * **Q. Why does Arduino IDE prompt me to upgrade library files when I open it? Should I upgrade or not?** A. Choose not to upgrade library files. Different versions of library files may not be compatible with each other, so upgrading is not recommended. <br /> * **Q. Why is there no serial data output from the \"Uart\" interface on my board? Is it broken?** A. Because the project file is configured by default to use the USB interface as Uart0 serial output for debugging, and the \"Uart\" interface is connected to Uart0, it won't output any data without configuration.<br />PlatformIO users: Open the project file \"platformio.ini\", change the option \" DARDUINO_USB_CDC_ON_BOOT true\" under \"build_flags xxx\" to \" DARDUINO_USB_CDC_ON_BOOT false\" to use the external \"Uart\" interface normally.<br />Arduino users: Open the \"Tools\" menu, select USB CDC On Boot: \"Disabled\" to use the external \"Uart\" interface normally. <br /> * **Q. Why does my board keep failing to upload programs?** A.

Hold the **BOOT** button on the side of `T PicoPro`, then plug in the **USB C**. If the computer recognizes it as a disk, then this is the **RP2350** port. * Besides being used as UART, the `QWIIC` UART port of T PicoPro can also be used as general IO. * The `QWIIC` I2C port cannot be used for other purposes and can only be configured as an I2C interface, as it is connected to the screen touch and PMU. * **ESP32C6** uses modified AT firmware with `TX and RX swapped`. You can find the custom compilation method for AT firmware [here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp at/en/latest/esp32c6/AT_Command_Set/index.html). * **ESP32 C6** default AT firmware is compiled at `V3.3.0 dev`. This firmware has been simply modified (added GPIO control function), source code can be found [here](https://github.com/lewisxhe/esp at), specific changes please see [commit](https://github.com/lewisxhe/esp at/commit/66f9f164584fbf6e01158b5fb5578f0fd495b498). * **T PicoPro** charging indicator can be turned off via software. If no battery is connected, the indicator will flash. ### PlatformIO Quick Start (Recommended) 1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) 2.

I still don't know how to set up the programming environment after reading the above tutorial. What should I do?** A. If you still don't understand how to set up the environment after reading the above tutorial, you can refer to the [LilyGo Document](https://github.com/Xinyuan LilyGO/LilyGo Document) documentation for setup instructions. * **Q. Why does Arduino IDE prompt me to upgrade library files when I open it? Should I upgrade or not?** A. Choose not to upgrade library files. Different versions of library files may not be compatible with each other, so upgrading is not recommended. * **Q. Why is there no serial data output from the \"Uart\" interface on my board? Is it broken?** A. Because the project file is configured by default to use the USB interface as Uart0 serial output for debugging, and the \"Uart\" interface is connected to Uart0, it won't output any data without configuration.

I still don't know how to set up the programming environment after reading the above tutorial. What should I do?** A. If you still don't understand how to set up the environment after reading the above tutorial, you can refer to the [LilyGo Document](https://github.com/Xinyuan LilyGO/LilyGo Document) documentation for setup instructions. * **Q. Why does Arduino IDE prompt me to upgrade library files when I open it? Should I upgrade or not?** A. Choose not to upgrade library files. Different versions of library files may not be compatible with each other, so upgrading is not recommended. * **Q. Why is there no serial data output from the \"Uart\" interface on my board? Is it broken?** A. Because the project file is configured by default to use the USB interface as Uart0 serial output for debugging, and the \"Uart\" interface is connected to Uart0, it won't output any data without configuration. PlatformIO users: Open the project file \"platformio.ini\", change the option \" DARDUINO_USB_CDC_ON_BOOT true\" under \"build_flags xxx\" to \" DARDUINO_USB_CDC_ON_BOOT false\" to use the external \"Uart\" interface normally. Arduino users: Open the \"Tools\" menu, select USB CDC On Boot: \"Disabled\" to use the external \"Uart\" interface normally. * **Q. Why does my board keep failing to upload programs?** A. Please hold down the \"BOOT 0\" button and try uploading again. ## Projects * [T Display S3 AMOLED 1.43 1.75_V1.0](https://github.com/Xinyuan LilyGO/T Display S3 AMOLED 1.43 1.75/blob/main/project/T Display S3 AMOLED 1.43 1.75_V1.0.pdf) ## Resources * [PCF8563](https://github.com/Xinyuan LilyGO/T Display S3 AMOLED 1.43 1.75/blob/main/information/PCF8563.pdf) * [SH8601](https://github.com/Xinyuan LilyGO/T Display S3 AMOLED 1.43 1.75/blob/main/information/SH8601Z.pdf) * [DO0143FAT10](https://github.com/Xinyuan LilyGO/T Display S3 AMOLED 1.43 1.75/blob/main/information/DO0143FMST10 DWO.pdf) * [AN_SY6970](https://github.com/Xinyuan LilyGO/T Display S3 AMOLED 1.43 1.75/blob/main/information/AN_SY6970.pdf) * [EVB_SY6970](https://github.com/Xinyuan LilyGO/T Display S3 AMOLED 1.43 1.75/blob/main/information/EVB_SY6970.pdf) ## Dependent Libraries * [Arduino_GFX 1.3.7](https://github.com/moononournation/Arduino_GFX) * [Arduino_DriveBus 1.1.16]() * [JPEGDEC 1.2.8](https://github.com/bitbank2/JPEGDEC) * [lvgl 8.3.5](https://lvgl.io) * [MiniTV](https://github.com/moononournation/MiniTV) * [SensorLib](https://github.com/lewisxhe/SensorsLib)"},"/get_started/en/Display/T-Display-K230/T-Display-K230.html":{"title":"LILYGO T-Display K230","content":" title: LILYGO T Display K230 show_source: false tags: K230, AIoT, LoRa, AMOLED, RISC V <div style \"width:100%; display:flex;justify content: center;\"> ![T Display K230](./assets/K256outlook1.jpg) </div> <div style \"padding: 1em 0 0 0; display: flex; justify content: center\"> <a target \"_blank\" style \"margin: 1em;color: white; font size: 0.9em; border radius: 0.3em; padding: 0.5em 2em; background color:rgb(103, 175, 8)\" href \"https://lilygo.cc/products/t display k230\">Official Store</a> </div> ## Version History: Version Update Date Update Description : : : : : T Display K230_V1.0 2024 01 01 Initial Version ## Purchase Link Product SOC Memory Storage Link : : : : : : : : : : T Display K230 K230 + ESP32 S3 8Gb LPDDR4 16MB FLASH + TF Card [LILYGO Mall](https://lilygo.cc/products/t display k230) ## Table of Contents [Description](#description) [Preview](#preview) [Modules](#modules) [K230 SDK Quick Development Guide](#k230 sdk quick development guide) ## Description T Display K230 is a new product based on Canaan Technology's latest K230 chip, following the K210.

After downloading the source code, use the command 'make prepare_sourcecode' to automatically download the toolchain to the current compilation directory. If you don't use the docker compilation environment but prefer to use native Linux for compilation, you can refer to `tools/docker/Dockerfile` to install the corresponding tools into your Linux system. If the download speed is slow or unsuccessful, you can use `tools/docker/Dockerfile` to compile the docker image yourself. For details, please refer to [K230 SDK Usage Instructions](https://github.com/kendryte/k230_docs/blob/main/zh/01_software/board/K230_SDK_使用说明.md#43 编译 sdk) ### Compiling K230 SDK #### Download K230 SDK Source Code ```shell git clone https://github.com/kendryte/k230_sdk cd k230_sdk make prepare_sourcecode ``` >`make prepare_sourcecode` will automatically download Linux and RT Smart toolchain, buildroot package, AI package, etc. Please ensure this command executes successfully without any Errors. Download time and speed depend on actual network speed. #### Start Compiling K230 SDK Taking docker image compilation as an example: 1. Confirm the current directory is the `k230_sdk` source code root directory, 2. Use the following command to enter docker ```shell docker run u root it v $(pwd):$(pwd) v $(pwd)/toolchain:/opt/toolchain w $(pwd) ghcr.io/kendryte/k230_sdk /bin/bash ``` >Select different config configurations for compilation based on different development boards or software functions. Compilation command format: `make CONF xxx`, for example: >To compile K230 USIP LP3 EVB board image, execute `make CONF k230_evb_defconfig` command to start compilation >To compile CanMV K230 board image, execute `make CONF k230_canmv_defconfig` command to start compilation > The automatically downloaded toolchain in the external directory will be mapped to the `/opt/toolchain/` directory in the docker image. > The default parameter ` u root` specifies docker to execute as root user, k230_sdk can be compiled without root permissions > Please use the complete path `ghcr.io/kendryte/k230_sdk` for the docker image. If using a locally compiled docker image, please modify the name accordingly #### Compilation Products Introduction Taking the products generated by make CONF k230_evb_defconfig compilation as an example: ```shell k230_evb_defconfig/images ├── big core ├── env.env ├── jffs2.env ├── little core ├── sysimage sdcard.img # SD and eMMC non secure boot image ├── sysimage sdcard.img.gz # SD and eMMC non secure boot image compressed package ├── sysimage spinor32m.img # norflash non secure boot image ├── sysimage spinor32m.img.gz # norflash non secure boot image compressed package └── sysimage spinor32m_jffs2.img # norflash jffs2 non secure boot image ``` Both TF card and eMMC can use the` sysimage sdcard.img` image, or use `sysimage sdcard.img.gz` decompressed to get this file. ### Pre compiled Image Download If you don't want to compile the image yourself, you can download pre compiled images and use them directly for flashing. 1. **[main branch](https://github.com/kendryte/k230_sdk/tree/main) ** as a release branch, compiled release images are automatically published to the [Release](https://github.com/kendryte/k230_sdk/releases) page. (Supported from v1.4 version) 2.Pre compiled release images: Please visit [Canaan Developer Community](https://developer.canaan creative.com/resource), then in the `K230/Images` category, download the required image files. For `evb` devices download` k230_evb*.img.gz`, for `canmv` devices download `k230_canmv*.img.gz`. >The downloaded images are in .gz compressed format by default, which needs to be decompressed first before flashing. >The K230 micropython image supports different functions compared to K230 SDK. ### Flashing Image Files #### Flashing TF Card If using Linux to flash TF card, you need to first confirm the TF card name in the system `/dev/sdx`, and replace `/dev/sdx` in the following command. ```shell sudo dd if sysimage sdcard.img of /dev/sdx bs 1M oflag sync ``` If using Windows for flashing, it is recommended to use the [rufus tool](http://rufus.ie/downloads/). For other more detailed flashing methods, please refer to K230 SDK documentation. ### Power On and Boot #### K230 EVB Development Board Power On and Boot K230 EVB supports multiple boot methods including SDCard, eMMC, norflash, etc. Users can switch between different boot modes by changing the boot [switch](https://github.com/kendryte/k230_docs/blob/main/zh/00_hardware/K230_DEMO_BOARD资源使用指南.md#电源区开机上电方式)settings on the board. For development convenience, it is recommended to prepare a TF card and set the boot switch to SD card boot mode. Later, you can consider burning the image file to eMMC. 1. Please first **confirm that the startup switch SW1 is set to the SD card startup mode** (for details, please refer to [Power on Method](https://github.com/kendryte/k230_docs/blob/main/zh/00_hardware/K230_DEMO_BOARD资源使用指南.md#电源区开机上电方式) 2. Insert the TF card with the completed burning into the TF card slot of the development board 3. Connect the power supply to the development board 4. **Pull the power switch K1 to the ON position**, and the system can be powered on and started 5. If you have connected the serial port, you can see the startup log output in the serial port. #### CanMV K230 Development Board Power On and Boot K230 CanMV K230 development board supports SDCard boot method and HDMI output display. Therefore, you need to prepare a TF card, and it is recommended to prepare an HDMI monitor. 1. Insert the TF card that has been programmed into the TF card slot of the development board. 2. Power on the development board. At this point, the system can be powered on and started. After the system is powered on, by default, there will be **two serial port devices**, which can be used respectively to access the small core Linux and the large core RTSmart. The default username for the small core Linux is \"root\" and the password is empty. In the large core RTSmart system, an application will automatically start at boot. You can press the `q` key to exit to the command prompt terminal. base platform: `Ubuntu 20.04` Refer to BUILD, you can use Docker or local environment for compilation, compilation speed is faster.Or refer to K230 CanMV Custom Firmware * Flashing: Under Linux, directly use the dd command for flashing. Under Windows, use flashing tools. Refer to K230 CanMV How to Flash Firmware. * Operator: * Compile firmware: ```shell cd canmv_k230 time make log ``` `canmv_k230/output/k230_canmv_v3p0` generates `CanMV K230 V3P0_rtsmart_localnncase_v2.9.0.img` which can be burned onto an SD card * Compile app: Change to current directory canmv_k230 ```shell cd canmv_k230/src/rtsmart/mpp source build_env.sh cd userapps/sample/sample_display make ``` In the sample/elf directory, generate sample_display.elf Default app: sample_display Rename sample_display.elf to `app.elf`, copy to the SD card's sdcard partition, reboot, and it will run by default."},"/get_started/en/no_translate.html":{"title":"no translation","content":" title: no translation class: md_page <div id \"visit_from\"></div> <div id \"no_translate_hint\">This page not translated yet</div> <div> <span id \"visit_hint\">Please visit</span> <a id \"translate_src\"></a> </div> <div> <script> function getQueryVariable(variable) { var query window.location.search.substring(1); var vars query.split(\"&\"); for (var i 0;i<vars.length;i++) { var pair vars[i].split(\" \"); if(pair[0] variable){return pair[1];} } return(false); } var ref getQueryVariable(\"ref\"); var from getQueryVariable(\"from\"); var link document.getElementById(\"translate_src\"); var fromDis document.getElementById(\"visit_from\"); link.href ref; link.text ref; fromDis.innerHTML from; </script> </div>"}}
